## Compiling this Pallet

This `offchain-demo` pallet is included in the
[ocw-runtime](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/runtimes/ocw-runtime).
In order to use this runtime in the kitchen node, we open the `nodes/kitchen-node/Cargo.toml` file,
enable the `ocw-runtime` package and comment out the `super-runtime` package.

Then we build the kitchen node with `ocw` feature flag:

```bash
# Switch to kitchen-node directory
cd nodes/kitchen-node

# Compile with OCW feature
cargo build --release --features ocw
```

With this feature flag, an account key is also injected into the Substrate node keystore.

src:
[`nodes/kitchen-node/src/service.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/blob/master/nodes/kitchen-node/src/service.rs)

```rust
// Initialize seed for signing transaction using off-chain workers
#[cfg(feature = "ocw")]
{
	keystore.write().insert_ephemeral_from_seed_by_type::<runtime::offchain_demo::crypto::Pair>(
		"//Alice", runtime::offchain_demo::KEY_TYPE
	).expect("Creating key with account Alice should succeed.");
}
```

## Life-cycle of Off-chain Worker

Running the `kitchen-node` you will see log messages similar to the following and realize nothing
much is special:

```

This is because currently off-chain worker is run after a block is imported. Our kitchen node is
configured to use [instant-seal consensus](/kitchen-node.md), so we need to send a transaction to
trigger a block to be imported.

Once a transaction is sent, such as using [Polkadot-JS App](https://polkadot.js.org/apps) to
perform a balance transfer, the following more interesting logs are shown.

```

```

Let's take a deeper look at what's happening here. Referring to the code at
[`pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs),
there is an `fn offchain_worker()` function inside `decl_module!`. This is the entry point of the
off-chain worker logic which is executed once per block import.

As off-chain workers, by definition, run computation off-chain, they cannot alter the block state. In
order to do so, they need to send transactions back on-chain. Three kinds of transaction can be sent
here, **signed transactions**, **unsigned transactions**, and **unsigned transactions with signed payload**.

- Signed transactions are used if the transaction requires the sender to be specified.
- Unsigned transactions are used when the sender does not need to be known.
- Unsigned transactions with signed payload are used, [TK]

We will walk through each of them in the following.

## Signed Transactions

> **Notes**: This example will have account `Alice` submitting signed transactions to the node in
> the off-chain worker, and these transactions have associated fees. If you run the node in development
> mode (with `--dev` flag) using the default sr25519 crypto signature, `Alice` will have sufficient funds
> initialized in the chain and this example will run fine. Otherwise, please be aware `Alice` account
> must be funded to run this example.

### Setup

For signed transactions, we have to define a crypto signature sub-module:

src:
[`pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs)

```rust
pub const KEY_TYPE: KeyTypeId = KeyTypeId(*b"demo");

pub mod crypto {
	use crate::KEY_TYPE;
	use sp_runtime::app_crypto::{app_crypto, sr25519};
	// -- snip --
	app_crypto!(sr25519, KEY_TYPE);
}
```

`KEY_TYPE` is the application key prefix for the pallet in the underlying storage. This is to be used for signing transactions.

Second, we have our pallet configration trait be additionally bounded by `CreateSignedTransaction` and add an additional associated type `AuthorityId`. This tell the runtime that this pallet can create signed transactions.

src:
[`pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs)

```rust
pub trait Trait: system::Trait + CreateSignedTransaction<Call<Self>> {
	/// The identifier type for an offchain worker.
	type AuthorityId: AppCrypto<Self::Public, Self::Signature>;
	// -- snip --
}
```

Now if we [build the `kitchen-node`](#compiling-this-pallet), we will see compiler errors saying three trait
bounds are not satisfied: `Runtime: frame_system::offchain::CreateSignedTransaction`,
`frame_system::offchain::SigningTypes`, and `frame_system::offchain::SendTransactionTypes`. So let's implement these traits in our runtime.

src:
[`runtimes/ocw-runtime/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/runtimes/ocw-runtime/src/lib.rs)

```rust
impl<LocalCall> frame_system::offchain::CreateSignedTransaction<LocalCall> for Runtime
where
	Call: From<LocalCall>,
{
	fn create_transaction<C: frame_system::offchain::AppCrypto<Self::Public, Self::Signature>>(
		call: Call,
		public: <Signature as sp_runtime::traits::Verify>::Signer,
		account: AccountId,
		index: Index,
	) -> Option<(
		Call,
		<UncheckedExtrinsic as sp_runtime::traits::Extrinsic>::SignaturePayload,
	)> {
		let period = BlockHashCount::get() as u64;
		let current_block = System::block_number()
			.saturated_into::<u64>()
			.saturating_sub(1);
		let tip = 0;
		let extra: SignedExtra = (
			frame_system::CheckTxVersion::<Runtime>::new(),
			frame_system::CheckGenesis::<Runtime>::new(),
			frame_system::CheckEra::<Runtime>::from(generic::Era::mortal(period, current_block)),
			frame_system::CheckNonce::<Runtime>::from(index),
			frame_system::CheckWeight::<Runtime>::new(),
			pallet_transaction_payment::ChargeTransactionPayment::<Runtime>::from(tip),
		);

		#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), allow(unused_variables))]
		let raw_payload = SignedPayload::new(call, extra)
			.map_err(|e| {
				debug::native::warn!("SignedPayload error: {:?}", e);
			})
			.ok()?;

		let signature = raw_payload.using_encoded(|payload| C::sign(payload, public))?;

		let address = account;
		let (call, extra, _) = raw_payload.deconstruct();
		Some((call, (address, signature, extra)))
	}
}
```

The overall goal is to perform the following:

- Signing the on-chain `call` and `extra` payload of the call. This together is called the signature.
- Finally returning the on-chain `call`, the account/address making the signature, the signature
itself, and the `extra` payload.

The `SignedExtra` data type used above is defined later in our runtime.

src:
[`runtimes/ocw-runtime/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/runtimes/ocw-runtime/src/lib.rs)

```rust
/// The SignedExtension to the basic transaction logic.
pub type SignedExtra = (
	frame_system::CheckSpecVersion<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckTxVersion<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckGenesis<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckEra<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckNonce<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckWeight<Runtime>,
	pallet_transaction_payment::ChargeTransactionPayment<Runtime>,
);
```

Next the remaining two traits are also implemented by specifying the concrete types of their respective trait associated types.

src:
[`runtimes/ocw-runtime/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/runtimes/ocw-runtime/src/lib.rs)

```rust
impl frame_system::offchain::SigningTypes for Runtime {
	type Public = <Signature as sp_runtime::traits::Verify>::Signer;
	type Signature = Signature;
}

impl<C> frame_system::offchain::SendTransactionTypes<C> for Runtime
where
	Call: From<C>,
{
	type OverarchingCall = Call;
	type Extrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic;
}
```

By now, we have completed the setup of implementing the necessary trait bounds for our runtime to
create signed transactions.

### Sending Signed Transactions

A signed transaction is sent with `frame_system::offchain::SendSignedTransaction::send_signed_transaction`, as shown below:

src:
[`pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs)

```rust
fn signed_submit_number(block_number: T::BlockNumber) -> Result<(), Error<T>> {
	let signer = Signer::<T, T::AuthorityId>::all_accounts();

	// -- snip --

	// Using `SubmitSignedTransaction` associated type we create and submit a transaction
	// representing the call, we've just created.
	// Submit signed will return a vector of results for all accounts that were found in the
	// local keystore with expected `KEY_TYPE`.
	let submission: u64 = block_number.try_into().ok().unwrap() as u64;
	let results = signer.send_signed_transaction(|_acct| {
		// We are just submitting the current block number back on-chain
		Call::submit_number_signed(submission)
	});

	for (acc, res) in &results {
		match res {
			Ok(()) => {
				debug::native::info!(
					"off-chain send_signed: acc: {:?}| number: {}",
					acc.id,
					submission
				);
			}
			Err(e) => {
				debug::error!("[{:?}] Failed in signed_submit_number: {:?}", acc.id, e);
				return Err(<Error<T>>::SignedSubmitNumberError);
			}
		};
	}
	Ok(())
}
```

On the above code, we first retrieve a signer. Then we send a signed transaction on-chain by calling `send_signed_transaction` with a closure returning the on-chain call, `Call::submit_number_signed(submission)`.

Notice that we run a loop in the returned result, meaning we are expecting the above call may make multiple transactions and return multiple results. This is because `send_signed_transaction` send transactions with each of the accounts found under the application crypto (which we defined earlier in `pub mod crypto {...}`). Right now we only have one key in the app crypto, so only one signed transaction is made.

Eventually, the `call` transaction will be made on-chain via the `frame_system::offchain::CreateSignedTransaction::create_transaction` function we defined in our runtime.

## Unsigned Transactions

### Setup

By default, unsigned transactions are rejected by the runtime unless they are explicitly
allowed. So we need to write logic to allow unsigned transactions for certain particular
dispatched functions as follows:

src:
[`pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs)

```rust
impl<T: Trait> support::unsigned::ValidateUnsigned for Module<T> {
	type Call = Call<T>;

	fn validate_unsigned(_source: TransactionSource, call: &Self::Call) -> TransactionValidity {
		if let Call::submit_number_unsigned(number) = call {
			debug::native::info!("off-chain send_unsigned: number: {}", number);

			ValidTransaction::with_tag_prefix("offchain-demo")
				.priority(T::UnsignedPriority::get())
				.and_provides([b"submit_number_unsigned"])
				.longevity(3)
				.propagate(true)
				.build()
		} else {
			InvalidTransaction::Call.into()
		}
	}
}
```

By implementing `ValidateUnsigned`, the allowance logic is added inside the `validate_unsigned`
function. We verify that if the call is `Call::submit_number_unsigned` we return `Ok()`, otherwise `InvalidTransaction::Call`.

Note that the`ValidTransaction` object has some fields that touch on concepts that we have not discussed
before:

-   `priority`: Ordering of two transactions, given their dependencies are satisfied.
-   `requires`: List of tags the transaction depends on.
-   `provides`: List of tags provided by this transaction. Successfully importing the transaction
    will enable other transactions that depend on these tags to be included as well.
-   Both`provides` and
    `requires` tags allow Substrate to build a dependency graph of transactions and import them in
    the right order.
-   `longevity`: Transaction longevity, which describes the minimum number of blocks the transaction
    is valid for. After this period the transaction should be removed from the pool or revalidated.
-   `propagate`: Indication if the transaction should be propagated to other peers. By setting to
    `false` the transaction will still be considered for inclusion in blocks that are authored on
    the current node, but will never be sent to other peers.

We are using the
[builder pattern](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns/blob/master/patterns/builder.md) to
build up this object.

Finally, to tell the runtime that we have our own `ValidateUnsigned` logic, we also need to pass
this as a parameter when constructing the runtime:

src:
[`runtimes/ocw-runtime/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/runtimes/ocw-runtime/src/lib.rs)

```rust
construct_runtime!(
	pub enum Runtime where
		Block = Block,
		NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
		UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic
	{
		//...snip
		OffchainDemo: offchain_demo::{Module, Call, Storage, Event<T>, ValidateUnsigned},
	}
);
```

### Sending Unsigned Transactions

We can now make an unsigned transaction from offchain worker with the
`T::SubmitUnsignedTransaction::submit_unsigned` function, as shown in the code.

src:
[`pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/offchain-demo/src/lib.rs)

```rust
fn send_unsigned(block_number: T::BlockNumber) -> Result<(), Error<T>> {
	use system::offchain::SubmitUnsignedTransaction;

	let submission: u64 = block_number.try_into().ok().unwrap() as u64;
	// the `block_number` param should be unique within each block generation phase
	let call = Call::submit_number_unsigned(block_number, submission);

	T::SubmitUnsignedTransaction::submit_unsigned(call).map_err(|e| {
		debug::native::error!("Failed to submit unsigned tx: {:?}", e);
		<Error<T>>::SendUnsignedError
	})
}
```

As in signed transactions, we prepare a function reference with its parameters and call
`T::SubmitUnsignedTransaction::submit_unsigned`.
