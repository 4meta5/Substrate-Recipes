# Custom RPCs
TODO link to code

Remote Procedure Calls, or RPCs, are a way for an external program (eg. a frontend) to communicate with a Substrate node. They are used for checking storage values, submitting transactions, and querying the current consensus authorities. Substrate comes with several [default RPCs](https://polkadot.js.org/api/substrate/rpc.html). In many cases it is useful to add custom RPCs to your node. In this recipe, we will add two custom RPCs to our node, one of which calls into a [custom runtime API](./runtime-api.md).
