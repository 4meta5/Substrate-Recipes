# Debugging

In certain situations, some changes can introduce errors in our code. It becomes an impossible task to think about all possible permutations that the code execution will need to handle. Debugging becomes an integral part of all software development to detect and remove existing or potential errors.

Most of the same tools used for Rust debugging also apply to Substrate. However, there are some restrictions on these tools. 
To facilitate the debugging of the runtime, Substrate provides extra tools for this.
